# Web-Dev-Midterm
My Midterm project for my ICS 118 course. A fan page website with a video background. HTML and CSS only

File contains a skeleton website built for Desktop, iPhone 6/7/8, and iPad

Built using HTML and CSS only using images from the Slay the Spire game from Mega Crit Games 
and a video from the NeverKnowsBest youtube channel
