			<h1>Quick Player Guide</h1><!--Player guide written by me. It's not very coherent advice because I am a casual-->
			<p class="font-effect-outline"><!--font effect allows better readability on this sections background-->Slay the spire is a rogue-like game. Don't be upset if you cant slay the spire on the first try. 
			As you progress in the game, you player will unlock new cards and relics which may provide powerful bonuses for your run.
			Collecting relics and upgrading cards are the best way for a player to go far in a particular run. There are three main Acts in the game the player will have to endure, each with their own unique set of bosses.
			Certain bosses can be countered with specific stratgies or tactics so be sure to know which boss you will be facing at the end of your Act.</p>
			<p class="font-effect-outline">Character playstyles will vary from run to run. Some runs will be filled with cards that combo well together but will fail against a certain opponent.
			Runs generally cannot be mimicked but can be quite similar. Don't try to rebuild the epic combo deck you may have gotten on a previous run. Just use what you are given.
			Note that cards and relics do not always have to be collected at the end of a floor. The player can pick and choose what they feel is best. A good strategy for 
			players looking to save health is by picking the route with the most ? rooms as they have a lower chance of combat. A good strategy for players looking to collect relics
			is to pick the route with the most elite combats since elittes are guarenteed to drop a relic at the end of combat. Elites are much more powerful than normal enemies,
			so this strategy is not for the faint of heart.</p>
